# Plutonium Linux Guide

We've all been there, wanting to play COD on our linux machines, only to find out they are a HUGE security risk. That's why these launchers like Plutonium for this guide exist. While Linux users may not be as affected with these security issues due to us using WINE/Proton, still most of our friends over at Windows still wanna play cod without their PCs turning into bricks or worse, getting info stolen.

# Quick Notice

This is NOT a piracy guide on how to obtain these games, they are recommended by the Plutonium Team to obtain them via Steam.

This is not in any way shape or form affilated with Plutonium or the Plutonium Team, we just like the client and want it playable on Linux

# FOR STEAM DECK LCD USERS

We suggest to NEVER play plutonium on an LCD steam deck, this is due to one cheater deciding to cheat on a steam deck and Plutonium with their wisdom decided to hardware ban EVERY SINGLE LCD MODEL. Now this is due to Valve making them all the same ID, but we really gonna ban millions of steam decks over one cheater? Get your act together Plutonium...
